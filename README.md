# About Me Project

## Author : Adrian Hernandez

## Lab 02
-Did basic setup for About Me. I set up the html file first and did some css styling. I formulated five different questions that needed alerts to notify the user whether or not they answered them correctly. The .toLowerCase() function was really helpful in healping me convert the user responses to an answer that would work in my code.

## Lab 03
The main point of this project was to create loops that would allow the user to only be able to guess the answer to a question a limited amount of times. One involved just guessing a number and the other involved having work include an array that gave the user multiple possible answers to the same question. There were a lot of issues that were difficult for me to solve.

## Lab 04
Today we collaborated with another student from our course. This was very enlightening. We were able to talk through issues with another person which was really nice. Having an extra set of eyes makes things run a lot smoother. We did run into some issues and we were able to solve most of them on our own. It was nice being able to try out being both a navigator and a driver in this exercise and seeing how both sides work.
